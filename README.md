## Purpose
What this tableau visualiztion is meant to do is to coerce investors that a bike-sharing program like Citi Bike in New York City could be done in Des Moines with great success. So for that to be done these visualizations had been made.

## Analyses
A heat map showing where trips and how many from that location and then a secondary map of the same data but rather show the end of the trips.

From the data below we see that Citi Bikes are used for short trips with a strong male audience. What we can infer from this is that the commuters are using this could be a heavy amount of day laborers.  Having the ability to quickly get to their worksite in a crowded city utilizing small avenues is a strong advantage over subways, taxis, or ride-share services.
