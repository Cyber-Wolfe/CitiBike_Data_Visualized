## Purpose
What this tableau visualiztion is meant to do is to coerce investors that a bike-sharing program like Citi Bike in New York City could be done in Des Moines with great success. So for that to be done these visualizations had been made.

## Analyses
A heat map showing where trips start and how many from that location and then a secondary map of the same data but rather show the end of the trips.

From the data below we see that Citi Bikes are used for short trips with a strong male audience. What we can infer from this is that the commuters are using this could be a heavy amount of day laborers.  Having the ability to quickly get to their worksite in a crowded city utilizing small avenues is a strong advantage over subways, taxis, or ride-share services.

Previous data further is supported with this heatmap , breaking down the Citi Bike usage by gender.  We can infer that from 7am-9am and 4pm-7pm are the peak hours based on the severity of the color due to the rush hour times. Then Satruday and Sunday for each gender showing a more steady use of the bikes, most likely due to leisure activities.

A weekday breakdown to show commuting and leisure uses during the week of Citi Bike. Saturday and Sunday displayed a steady use from 8am to 7pm. Although weekdays during commuting times (7am-9am and 4pm-7pm) still show a greater use. Strangely though there is a gap on Wednesday of intensity on the 4pm-7pm timeframe that doesn't match the other days. The secondary heatmap just reinforces the previous claims.

## Results

The Citi Bike initiative plays a key factor in commuting and leisure activities in New York City from the data gathered. Adding these bikes into Des Moines would most likely be a great revenue generator, a congestion sweeper by reducing cars on the road, and a fun leisure activity for getting around the city when walking won't cut it. 
We find that Males during rush hour are the largest users of the bikes and contribute to most of their use and both genders on the weekend use the bikes in tandem, although males still seem to be the heavy user of the service.

## Suggestion for NYC's Future
A void of users in the west bronx area could mean that a new station(s) could be placed in the area. There is a use split of subscribers and customers in the area which could be merged with an influx of stations. This influx could trickle down through the Bronx and help create a greater influx for the area.
