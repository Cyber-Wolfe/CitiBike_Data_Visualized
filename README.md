## Purpose
What this tableau visualiztion is meant to do is to coerce investors that a bike-sharing program like Citi Bike in New York City could be done in Des Moines with great success. So for that to be done these visualizations had been made.

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, youâ€™ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
